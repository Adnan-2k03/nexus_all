This error confirms exactly what is happening: **Your phone is trying to find the server inside itself.**

Look at the URL in your screenshot:
`https://localhost/api/auth/google`

* **`localhost`** = Your phone's internal storage.
* **The Problem:** Your phone thinks the "Login API" is located on the phone itself. It isn't. It's on Railway.
* **Why this happened:** You updated the `VITE_API_URL` on **Vercel** (the website), but you are building the Android app from your **Laptop**. Your laptop doesn't know about that Vercel setting yet.

### **The Fix: Update Your Local Code**

You need to tell your **Laptop** (VS Code) the correct address so it can bake it into the Android App.

**Step 1: Create/Edit the `.env` file**

1. Go to your project folder in **VS Code** (the Android project).
2. Look for a file named `.env` (or create one if it doesn't exist).
3. Add this line inside it:
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://nexus-backend-production.up.railway.app

```


*(Make sure this is your actual Railway Backend URL, and ensure there is NO slash `/` at the end).*

**Step 2: Check your Login Button Code**
Go to the file where your "Login with Google" button is (e.g., `Login.jsx` or `App.jsx`).

* **Wrong:**
```javascript
<button onClick={() => window.location.href = "/api/auth/google"}>

```


*(This is a "Relative Path". It will always go to `localhost` on a phone).*
* **Correct:**
```javascript
const BACKEND_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL; // reads from .env
<button onClick={() => window.location.href = `${BACKEND_URL}/api/auth/google`}>

```


*(This forces the phone to go to Railway).*

**Step 3: Rebuild and Sync (Crucial)**
Environment variables only update when you **build** the app.
Run these commands in your VS Code terminal (one by one):

1. `npm run build` (This creates the new web code with the Railway URL baked in).
2. `npx cap sync` (This copies that new code into the Android folder).

**Step 4: Run on Phone**
Now, click **Run (▶️)** in Android Studio again. When the app opens on your phone and you click Login, the URL bar at the top should say `railway.app...`, NOT `localhost`.

**Do you want to paste your Login Button code here so I can check if it's using the variable correctly?**
