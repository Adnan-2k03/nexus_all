"I want to upgrade the NexusMatch tournament system with a Multi-Player Team Registration and Anti-Cheat/Banning system.

Tournament Setup:
Allow an 'Admin Description' field for each tournament.

The 'Players per Team' field determines the mode. If it’s > 1, the following logic applies.

Team Registration & Invitations:
The Leader: When a user registers for a team tournament (e.g., Duos or Trios), they act as the Leader.

The Invite: The Leader must input the 'NexusMatch ID' of their teammates (e.g., 2 members for Duos, 3 for Trios).

Pending Status: Registration is NOT confirmed immediately. It stays as 'Pending.'

Confirmation: Each teammate must log in and 'Accept' the invitation to that specific team.

Auto-Confirm: Users can toggle a setting to 'Auto-Confirm' invitations from specific friends/leaders they trust.

Validation: A user cannot be part of two different teams in the same tournament.

Team Layouts/Presets:
Let users create and save 'Team Layouts' (e.g., 'My Pro Trio'). They can reuse these saved teams for future tournaments without re-entering IDs.

Tournament History:
Create a 'Match History' tab. Store the tournament name, date, and 'Highest Round Reached' (e.g., 'Quarter-Finalist', 'Winner', 'Round 1').

this was being done and it completed till below:

I have successfully implemented the team invitation system and fixed the issues with tournament registration.

Key Changes:
Team Invitations: Added a new endpoint /api/tournaments/invitations/:id/respond to allow players to accept or reject team invitations.
Tournament Registration: Fixed a bug where single-player registration was incorrectly requiring teammate IDs.
UI Improvements:
Updated the Tournaments component with better state management for registration.
Added a refresh button to manually sync tournament data.
Improved the display of tournament status and host details.
Code Health: Resolved several JSX syntax errors and import issues in the frontend components.
The application is now running correctly, and users can join tournaments both as individuals and as part of a team.
