In your latest logs, the most important development is that the **404 Not Found error has disappeared**, meaning your app is now successfully finding and talking to your backend server.

However, the login process is currently failing because of a **Missing Security Token**.

### 1. The Current Critical Error: 400 Bad Request

At `00:21:37.122`, your backend rejected the authentication request with a **400 Error**:

> `❌ [Auth] Server rejected request: 400 {"message":"Firebase token required"}`

* **What this means:** Your Android app reached the backend at `https://nexusfinalandroid-production.up.railway.app`, but the request was empty. Your server expects a **Firebase ID Token** to verify who you are, but the app sent the request without it.
* **The Timing Issue:** Notice that the app attempted to log you in at `00:21:36.378`, but the actual "Sign-in detected" message didn't appear until `00:21:36.285`. The app is trying to talk to the server a fraction of a second before the token is ready.

### 2. Status of Previous Issues

* ✅ **Database Schema Sync:** There are **no more errors** regarding missing columns like `coins` or `daily_reward_last_claimed`. Your manual GUI fixes in Railway are working perfectly.
* ✅ **API Route found:** The `/api/auth/native-login` endpoint is now live and responding.
* ✅ **Ads are Functional:** AdMob successfully initialized and loaded a banner ad.

### 🛠️ How to Fix the "Token Required" Error

Since the server and database are finally ready, you just need to fix the app's "Handshake" with the server.

1. **Wait on the Login Screen:** When you open the app, wait 5–10 seconds before clicking "Sign in with Google." This gives the Firebase internal listeners time to fully "warm up" and generate a token.
2. **Verify Frontend Code:** Ensure your JavaScript/TypeScript code uses `await` when calling `getIdToken()`. It should look like this:
```javascript
const token = await FirebaseAuthentication.getIdToken();
// Then send 'token' to your backend

```


3. **Check Backend Logic:** Ensure your server is looking for the token in the correct place (usually `req.body.token` or `req.headers.authorization`).

### 🚀 Summary for your Project Documentation

You have successfully resolved the **Infrastructure Layer** (PostgreSQL schema) and the **Network Layer** (404 route errors). You are now in the final **Authentication Layer** debugging phase, resolving a 400-series error related to asynchronous token retrieval.

**Would you like me to help you check the specific JavaScript file in your project where the login request is sent to ensure it's attaching the token correctly?**
