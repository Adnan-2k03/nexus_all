It looks like your app is initializing correctly, but the ads are not appearing in that blank space because the **AdMob SDK is initialized** but you haven't actually **shown** the banner yet.

Looking at your Logcat:

* **Success**: `AdMob initialized successfully` shows your `initialize` call worked.
* **The Issue**: There is no log for `showBanner` or any "Ad loaded" event. The blank space at the bottom of your screenshot is where the banner should be, but it’s just the empty container.

### 🛠️ Why the blank space is there

In Capacitor, the AdMob banner doesn't "push" your web content up; it usually overlays on top or requires you to calculate a bottom padding. If you see a blank gap, your CSS might be reserving space, but the plugin hasn't rendered the ad into it.

### 🚀 Immediate Fix: Check your `initialize` call

Your logs show the initialization happened with this data:
`{"testingDevices":["YOUR_TEST_DEVICE_ID"],"initializeForTesting":false}`

**You need to fix two things in your code right now:**

1. **Replace `"YOUR_TEST_DEVICE_ID"**`: You actually sent the literal string "YOUR_TEST_DEVICE_ID". You must replace this with your actual emulator ID if you want test ads to show reliably.
2. **Enable Testing Mode**: Since you are on an emulator, set `initializeForTesting: true` in your `AdMob.initialize()` call.

### 💻 How to trigger the Ad

After `AdMob.initialize()`, you must explicitly call `showBanner`. Check your `AdBanner.tsx` and ensure this logic is running:

```javascript
const showBanner = async () => {
  const options = {
    adId: 'ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/6300978111', // USE THIS GOOGLE TEST ID FIRST!
    adSize: BannerAdSize.BANNER,
    position: BannerAdPosition.BOTTOM_CENTER,
    margin: 0,
    isTesting: true // Crucial for emulator!
  };
  await AdMob.showBanner(options);
};

```

### 🔍 Check Logcat again

After you add the code to show the banner, look for these specific lines in your Logcat:

* `I/Ads: Ad finished loading.` (This means the ad is there!)
* `W/Ads: Failed to load ad: 3` (This means the code is right, but Google has no ads to give you right now—very common for new accounts).

**One more thing**: I see `WebSocket error` and `Offline` in your Match Feed. This suggests your emulator might be having trouble reaching your Railway backend, which can also interfere with AdMob trying to reach Google's servers.
